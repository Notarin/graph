- Quick derivation builder #project-ideas
	- Script that uses several utilities to generate a derivation quickly
		- nix-build
		- autoPatchelfHook
- A PR for [wezterm](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm) to remove the requirement for wezterm to be installed on the remote system for wezterm domains to work over ssh #project-ideas
	- There's a flake.
	- A rough draft of what to do in order:
		- The obvious check for remote daemon, proceed that path if its there, else continue
		- check arch in a quick, consistent, and standard way (maybe the openssh daemon has a feature for this? otherwise its still ez). This is prob the step that will change in iterations
		- upload binary through ssh connection, prob to /tmp, checksum it on remote
		- spawn a PID with the daemon, NOHUP it
		- reattempt wezterm domain connection
- Fix git plugin issue [\#76](https://github.com/haydenull/logseq-plugin-git/issues/76)
	- Might have to make a flake.
